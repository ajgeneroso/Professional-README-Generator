# Professional-README-Generator

## Description
This is a command line interface application which creates a README file for your application repositories. This will allow people to understand how your app works, how to install it, and how other developers can contribute to your project.

## Installation
To install this app you will need to run npm install for the following dependencies in your CLI, inquirer, fs, and util. This will allow the question prompts from the CLI for you to create your README.md.

## Usage
Run the command node index.js in the intergrated terminal and the inquirer package will begin prompts for your README section information. As you answer each question you dynamically form the sections, and table of contents for your README.
